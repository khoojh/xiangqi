"""

Every time a player makes a move, the instruction is first passed through

the referee function (see bottom).

    - Instruction is in the form: piece moved, new location



The referee function:

- Prevents a player from moving opponent's pieces

- Prevents captured pieces from being moved

- Prevents pieces from moving off the board

- Prevents a piece from capturing an ally piece

- Detects when the game is over (general is captured) (or one when player surrenders??)



- Prevent pieces from making certain moves when other pieces are in the way

    - This is done using scanner functions.

    - Pieces with scanner functions are pieces the movement of which is dependent

      on other pieces (eg soldier is free to move forward, but elephant isn't if

      something's in the way. So, elephant needs a scanner function.)

    - Scanner function works by going through possible_moves and eliminating

      invalid ones

    - eg in possible_moves, elephant is free to move diagonally

      to 4 directions (4 possible moves), but if something is in the way in one

      direction, the total possible moves will be reduced. This is what scanners do



After referee is done, board.update_board() will be called

Updated board is then sent to display
